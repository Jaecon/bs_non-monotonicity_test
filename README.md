Bootstrap hypothesis testing for non-monotonicity of a regression mean
=====

This repository provides hypothesis testing for non-monotonicity of a regression mean with a bootstrap test statistic. Ellison and Ellison (2011) suggest the test statistic, modifying the monotonicity test in Hall and Heckman (2000). This work used Clemson University's Palmetto Cluster (56 cores of Intel Xeon 6238R) for parallel computing and took 5.5 hours approximately.
